# SettingsScreen
In this app I tried to make default iPhone settings screen. Cells are custom made in the table view. 
This app also has a second screen that represents detail view of each setting. 
I also used GCD to pop to root view controller after 7 seconds.

# Record of SettingScreen app work.
